    <h3>The Pomodoro Method</h3>
    <p>Have you ever found yourself struggling to maintain focus while studying or working
        on tasks? The Pomodoro Technique might just be the solution you've been searching for! This simple yet effective
        time management method encourages you to break your work into manageable intervals, typically 25 minutes each,
        separated by short breaks. Named after the Italian word for 'tomato' due to its creator's tomato-shaped kitchen
        timer, the Pomodoro Technique promotes productivity by helping you stay focused during work sessions and
        allowing for regular breaks to recharge."</p>
    <h3>The Feynman Technique</h3>
    <p>Named after the renowned physicist Richard Feynman, this technique advocates for the concept of 'learning by
        teaching.' It encourages you to break down complex ideas into simple explanations as if you were teaching them
        to a beginner. By doing so, you'll identify gaps in your understanding and refine your knowledge until it's
        crystal clear. The Feynman Technique emphasizes the importance of simplicity and clarity, making learning both
        effective and enjoyable. </p>
    <h3>The Blurt Method</h3>
    <p>The Blurt Method is a simple yet effective technique for brainstorming and organizing your thoughts. To begin,
        select a topic you want to explore or develop ideas about. Set a timer for a brief period, typically 10-15
        minutes, to dedicate to uninterrupted writing. During this time, let your thoughts flow freely onto the page
        without pausing to edit or structure them. Once the timer concludes, take a short break before returning to your
        writing. Use this opportunity to review what you've written and begin organizing your thoughts into a more
        cohesive outline or essay. By allowing yourself the freedom to 'blurt out' your ideas without inhibition, you'll
        often uncover valuable insights and creative solutions to explore further. </p>
    <h3>The SQ3R Method</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Survey: Begin by quickly skimming through the material you're about to read. Pay attention to headings,
            subheadings, and any bolded or italicized text. Look at any visual aids such as charts, graphs, or images.
            This step helps you get an overview of the content.
        </li>

        <li>Question: Formulate questions based on the material you've surveyed. These questions should focus on the
            main points or key concepts of the text. Asking questions helps you engage with the material and set a
            purpose for your reading.
        </li>

        <li>Read: Read the text actively and attentively. As you read, try to answer the questions you formulated in the
            previous step. Take notes, highlight important information, and annotate the text as needed. Pay close
            attention to any information that answers your questions.
        </li>

        <li>Recite: After reading a section of the text, pause and summarize what you've learned in your own words.
            Reciting helps reinforce your understanding of the material and commit it to memory. Try to recall key
            points and concepts without looking at the text.
        </li>

        <li>Review: Once you've finished reading the entire text, take some time to review your notes and the material
            as a whole. Reflect on the main ideas, key points, and any areas that you found challenging. Reviewing helps
            solidify your understanding and identify any gaps in your knowledge.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By following the SQ3R method, you can approach your reading assignments or study materials in a systematic
        and effective way, leading to better comprehension and retention of the content.

<div id="AboutUs" class="tabContent">
    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Hi, we are Deen Khan and Rithvik Nandhyala. We are both Northeastern freshman computer science majors.
        We always had trouble focusing while studying until we found the Pomodoro method, which completely
        changed our academic life. We wanted to be able to share these useful techniques with other students,
        while at the same time giving a short quiz to be able to give a method that benefits the user the most.
        This is our first WebDev project!</p>
